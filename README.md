# Mapping_Earthquakes

##Purpose
Basil and Sadhana woul like to see earthquake data compared to tectonic plates and their locations on the planet. They want to focus on quakes with magnitudes greater than 4.5. THey would like to utilize multiple maps to make the data easier to visual lize.
##Process
A starter map was utilized, then a second map was tectonic plate data was overlayed. The third data input was for major earthquakes and that was placed over the tectonic plate information.
##Findings
Very few high magnitude earthquakes happened off the fault lines, the only outlier was Alaska. This information will help Basil ad Sadhana focus efforts on where more information needs to come from.
